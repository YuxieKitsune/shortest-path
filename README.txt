Each of the algorithms can be found in their respective folders under src

Contraction Hierarchies and Two-Hop Labels are still not fully functional or yet not complete without modifications

To test the algorithms, use the respective test code for each algorithm.

Running EuclideanComparison, CHHeuristicTest, and AllTest will not work without modifying the code within each algorithm.
